## 🎯 What This Is

A modular, team-centered approach to scaling support operations from 7 analysts to 15+ while handling doubled business volume. Built on actual observations from three rounds of interviews with FieldStack's support team, account management, and leadership.

**Core principles:**
- Trust before change - Build relationships before implementing new processes
- Team as authors - Make existing analysts the architects of their own success
- Empower, don't control - Systems that enable independence, not approval theater
- Strategic asset - Position support as competitive advantage, not cost center

## 💡 Background

This plan was developed based on three interview rounds where I learned about:
- Two previous failures in this role (internal hire lacking leadership skills, external hire who couldn't learn the business)
- Upcoming growth: Two large retail clients expected to double year-over-year business
- Current challenges: Duplicate tickets from large clients, customer dependency on specific analysts, unclear escalation paths, no formal knowledge base
- Team dynamics: 7 technical support analysts with deep product knowledge but limited process structure

The plan addresses these specific challenges while building sustainable systems for growth.

## 🎓 Philosophy

**"Make the team the authors of their own success."**

Everything here is built on existing team expertise, with their input, for their benefit. When they succeed, support succeeds. When support succeeds, the company succeeds.

This isn't about imposing external solutions—it's about capturing what works, systematizing it, and scaling it. Internal promotions over external hires. Empowerment over control. Foundation before sophistication.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to the FieldStack team—Leela Goodrobb, Steve Leroux, JR Anderson, and Marysha Brown—for the thoughtful interview process and for sharing real challenges that made this plan grounded in actual operational needs rather than theoretical frameworks.

While I didn't get the role, I genuinely enjoyed thinking through these problems. Good luck with the growth ahead.
